Clone this repository if you're starting a new MoFo application.

The repo contains all the technologies we talk about in the [MoFo Engineering Handbook](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/MoFo-Engineering-Handbook)
and contains an example application that you can use as springboard
to develop your own application on, by rewriting the bits that are
in the example application to suit your needs, and extending it 
in accordance with the policies and guides outlined in the handbook.
