# The  Mozilla Foundation Client-Side Prototype 

Clone this repository if you're starting a new MoFo client-side application.

The repo contains all the technologies we talk about in the [MoFo Engineering Handbook](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/MoFo-Engineering-Handbook)
and contains an example application that you can use as springboard
to develop your own application on, by rewriting the bits that are
in the example application to suit your needs, and extending it
in accordance with the policies and guides outlined in the handbook.

**Note**: This repo is still under development.

## Using the current implementation

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to get everything set up.

## Development with live reloading

For a tight feedback loop between code changes and updates in the browser, the
code uses `gulp` for compilation and `gulp watch` for looking for file changes
that will kick off recompiles.

If you just want to compile run `$> gulp`. For convenient dev work, you can
use `$> gulp watch` instead, which will run the build tasks as well as set
up file change watching on the app and shared directories, automatically
starting up a live-reloading server for the gallery/editor apps.

Editing any .less or .jsx code should result in live recompiles, with the browser
automatically updating thanks to the magic of live-server's use of websockets.

## Current implementation details

This repo currently implements a single client-side applications, consuming
data from file, rather than from an API endpoint.

If the [Webmaker Login service](http://github.com/mozilla/login.webmaker.org) is running, webmaker login is used to control
whether or not "tiles" have editable titles and author fields.
